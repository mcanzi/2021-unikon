## Introduction

Can event-related potential data inform information flow order in speech perception? \pause i.e. what the extent of top-down mediation is during speech perception. 

## Event-related potentials

Event-related potentials (__ERP__) are measured brain responses that are direct result of a __sensory__, __cognitive__ or motor event (__Luck 2005__)

\pause

Event-related potential components are measured with electro-encephalography (__EEG__) equipment.

## Event-related potentials

__ERP__ (and EEG) offer unparalleled temporal resolution, \pause opening a direct window into cognitive processes of online language processing and __speech perception__. 

\pause

The original goal of my thesis was that to __design__ a handful of __ERP experiments to investigate lexical feedback__ and top-down processes of speech perception. \pause But how?

## Event-related potentials

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\item Mismatch Negativity (\textbf{MMN})
\item Phonological Mapping\textbf{*} Negativity (\textbf{PMN})
\item \textbf{N400}
\item \textbf{P600}
\end{itemize}

\tiny

\textbf{*} Originanly named Phonological Mismatch Negativity 

\normalsize

## MMN

\small

The mismatch negativity (MMN) is a cross-sensorial ERP component often observed in frontocentral regions of the scalp between 150 and 250 ms post stimulus onset \pause

The mismatch negativity reflects the perception of a deviant stimulus in a sequence of standard stimuli (e.g. Garrido et al., 2009) \pause

In the aud- itory domain, a deviant stimulus can be identified by differences in pitch, duration, stress and frequency range (Erlbeck et al., 2014)

\normalsize

## N400

The N400 (Kutas \& Hillyard 1980) is part of the normal brain response to words and other meaningful stimuli.
\pause
\begin{center}
nurse \pause doctor \pause | \pause  
pizza \pause pineapple \pause  
\end{center}

* Other paradigms include cloze-probability mismatch (e.g. Connolly and Phillips 1994)

## Phonological Mapping Negativity

The Phonological Mapping (or Mismatch) Negativity, __PMN__ is an event-related potential component hypothesized to index phonological mismatch and mapping \pause (e.g. Connolly and Phillips 1994; Connolly et al. 2001) 

## Phonological Mapping Negativity

However, while some studies (e.g. Connolly and Phillips 1994) have linked the PMN to phonological mapping during the lexical selection stage of speech perception..

\pause 

others (e.g. Newman & Connolly) report that the PMN is a __marker of acoustic and pre-lexical information__. 

## Connolly and Phillips (1994)

Event-Related Potential Components Reflect Phonological and Semantic Processing of the Terminal Word of Spoken Sentences: 

\pause

* The piano is out of \pause tune \pause (no mismatch) \pause
* The piano is out of \pause tuna \pause (N400) \pause
* The piano is out of \pause pizza \pause (N400 and PMN) \pause
* ...

## Newman et al. (2003)

Phoneme deletion task to study the PMN:

\pause

Delete /k/ from the word "clap" \pause

* lap \pause
* aap \pause
* dog 

## Phonological Mapping Negativity

__Lewendon et. al (2020)__ suggest that the possibility exists that the PMN is an extension of either the Mismatch Negativity (__MMN__) or __N400__ components

## Phonological Mapping Negativity

__Lewendon et. al (2020)__ also report that the majority of the literature on the PMN is characterized by contradictory findings and methodological limitations, e.g.

\small

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\item Contrasting theories of the PMN
\item Mixed topographical locations: 
  \begin{itemize}[<+->]
  \item \footnotesize Some studies report discovering the PMN in frontal and central sites, ohers in parietal / mid-line / evenly spread across the scalp.
  \end{itemize}
\item \small Methodological limitations: 
  \begin{itemize}[<+->]
  \item \footnotesize Few participants (usually < 10)
  \item \footnotesize Few trials (usually < 40)
  \item \footnotesize Confounding variables
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\normalsize

## Research questions

\pause \small

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\item \textbf{Is the PMN in response to acoustic, phonetic, phonological, lexical mapping and mismatch, none or a combination of all?}
\item \textbf{Is any other ERP component found in response to acoustic, phonetic and phonological mismatch in place of / together wih the PMN?}
\end{itemize}

\normalsize

## Research questions

Why the PMN.. \pause _and why now? _

\small \pause

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\item The PMN might play an important role in future investigations of architectures of grammar (placed in between acoustic and lexical processing)
\item Clinical studies have used the PMN as a \emph{marker of phonological processing abilities} (Robson et al. 2017). However, it is not clear what processes sexactly the PMN stands for. 
\end{itemize}

\normalsize

# Methods

# Experiment 1

## Procedure

\small

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\item Participants were trained to learn three pairs of tri-syllabic nonce words in a computerized training phase (e.g. \emph{pitabu dipida})
  \begin{itemize}[<+->]
  \item \footnotesize Transitional probabilities within the two items of each nonce-word pair was 1.0 
  \end{itemize}
\item \small Participants were tested on their knowledge of the experimental stimuli in a computerized task
\item During EEG data collection, stimuli were played back to participants during a passive listening task, however..
  \begin{itemize}[<+->]
  \item \footnotesize In 33\% of total trials, the first syllable of the second nonce-word of each pair would be manipulated to break expectations
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\normalsize

## Stimuli 

\begin{center}

pitabu \pause dipida \pause

pitabu \pause \textbf{ba}pida \pause

pitabu \pause \textbf{bu}pida \pause

\end{center}
\small

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\item Stimuli were synthesized using Mac OS Text-to-Speech
\item Vowel, syllable and word length were controlled for (each syllable was 200 ms long)
\item Speaker and pitch contours were the same for all stimuli.
\end{itemize}

## Participants

22 Participants (F = 13) took part to the experiment. 

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\item 22 right-handed adults
\item 22 BrE speakers
\item Age (M = 22, 18-25)
\item Normal or corrected to normal vision and hearing
\item No reported use of psychoactive medications
