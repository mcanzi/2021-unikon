# Introduction

## Event-related potentials

Event-related potentials (__ERP__) are measured brain responses that are direct result of a __sensory__, __cognitive__ or motor event (__Luck 2005__)

Event-related potential components are measured with electro-encephalography (__EEG__) equipment.

## Event-related potentials

Event-related potentials __can inform us about cognitive time-lines during processes such as__ online language processing and __speech perception__. ERP can be exploited to investigate architectures of grammar e.g. 

\small

* Information flow order during speech perception
* Mental representations

## Phonological Mapping Negativity

The Phonological Mapping (or Mismatch) Negativity, __PMN__ is an event-related potential component hypothesized to index pre-lexical phonological processing (__Connolly and Phillips 1994__; __Connolly et al. 2001__; ...) 

## Phonological Mapping Negativity

However, while some studies (e.g. __Connolly and Phillips 1994__) have linked the PMN to phonological mapping during the lexical selection stage of speech perception, others (e.g. __Newman \& Connolly__) report the ERP response is a marker of __acoustic and prelexical information__. 

## Phonological Mapping Negativity

__Lewendon et. al (2020)__ suggest that the possibility exists that the PMN is an extension of either the Mismatch Negativity (__MMN__) or N400 components (__Kutas and Hillyard 1980; Naatanen 1991__)

## Research question

* __Is the PMN in response to acoustic, phonetic, phonological, lexical mapping and mismatch, none or a combination of all?__

Why the PMN.. and why now? 

\small

* The PMN might play an important role in future investigations of architectures of grammar (placed in between acoustic and lexical processing)
+ Clinical studies have used the PMN as a __marker of phonological processing abilities__. However, it is not clear what exactly the PMN stands for.

# Methods

## Experimental design

__Three neuroimaging experiments__ designed to introduce new contexts in which to probe the elicitation of the PMN ERP component. Experiments 1, 2, and 3 were designed to work independently while being fully comparable.

## Equipment

Data collection

\small

* 64 active pin-type __BioSemi__ electrodes / _ActiView_
* Neurobehavioral Systems' __Presentation__

\normalsize

Software

\small

* MATLAB (2018b; 2019a; 2019b)
* EEGLAB (__Delorme & Makeig 2004__) 
* ERPLAB (__Lopez-Calderon & Luck, 2014__)
* R (4.1) (__R Core Team 2021__)

\normalsize

## Software

Data analysis

\small

* Exploratory channel-level multivariate testing with package `ERP` (__Causeur et al. 2020__) and the Adaptive Factor Adjustment (AFA) procedure (__Sheu et al. 2016__)
* Mean amplitude modelling with package `lme4` (__Bates et al. 2015__)

Data visualisation

* Grand-Average / difference ERP plots with `ggplot2` (__Wickham 2016__)
* Cubic spline interpolation scalp maps with package `akima` (__Akima and Gebhardt 2020__)

Averaged ERP data, statistical analysis code and model outputs / summaries, as well as visual exploration for all experiments, are freely available on GitHub at the repository `mcanzi/phd_codedata`

Thesis has been submitted and __will be available through open access__ following thesis defense (in August) and corrections.
