# Introduction

## Introduction

\begin{center}
Four years ago...
\end{center}

## Introduction

Can event-related potential data inform information flow order in speech perception? \pause i.e. what the extent of top-down mediation is during speech perception. 

## Event-related potentials

Event-related potentials (ERP) are measured brain responses that are direct result of a __sensory__, __cognitive__ or motor event (Luck 2005)

\pause

Event-related potential components are measured with electroencephalography (EEG) equipment.

## Introduction

Top-down vs bottom-up in speech perception: \pause

\item Interactive models of speech perception e.g. \textbf{TRACE} (McClelland \& Elman 1986)
\item Feed-forward / modular models of speech perception e.g. \textbf{Cohort} (Marslen-Wilson 1984)
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\item Ambiguous phonemes are solved more often with the choice that makes a word vs. a non-word 
\item e.g. Christma/s-\textesh/ more often solved as Christma/s/. 
\item Effect stronger at phoneme boundary.

## Introduction

Can event-related potential data inform information flow order in speech perception? \pause i.e. what the extent of top-down mediation is during speech perception. 

## Event-related potentials

ERP (and EEG) offer unparalleled temporal resolution, \pause opening a direct window into cognitive processes of online language processing and speech perception. 

\pause

The original goal of my thesis was that to __design__ a handful of __ERP experiments to investigate lexical feedback__ and top-down processes of speech perception. \pause But how?

## Event-related potentials

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\item Mismatch Negativity (\textbf{MMN})
\item Phonological Mapping\textbf{*} Negativity (\textbf{PMN})
\item \textbf{N400}
\item \textbf{P600}
\end{itemize}

\tiny

\textbf{*} Originanly named Phonological Mismatch Negativity 

\normalsize

## MMN

\small

The mismatch negativity (MMN) is a cross-sensorial ERP component often observed in frontocentral regions of the scalp between 150 and 250 ms post stimulus onset \pause

The mismatch negativity reflects the perception of a deviant stimulus in a sequence of standard stimuli (e.g. Garrido et al., 2009) \pause

In the auditory domain, a deviant stimulus can be identified by differences in pitch, duration, stress and frequency range (Erlbeck et al., 2014)

\normalsize

## MMN

However, the MMN was also found to be sensitive to phonological mapping (Pulvermuller 2001) \pause

\small
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\item MMN to the presentation of mismatching Finnish words
\item No MMN in control group
\end{itemize} \normalsize

## N400

The N400 (Kutas \& Hillyard 1980) is part of the normal brain response to words and other meaningful stimuli.
\pause
\begin{center}
nurse \pause doctor \pause | \pause  
pizza \pause pineapple \pause  
\end{center}

* Other paradigms include cloze-probability mismatch (e.g. Connolly and Phillips 1994)

## Phonological Mapping Negativity

The Phonological Mapping (or Mismatch) Negativity, __PMN__ is an event-related potential component hypothesized to index phonological mismatch and mapping \pause (e.g. Connolly and Phillips 1994; Connolly et al. 2001) 

## Phonological Mapping Negativity

However, while some studies (e.g. Connolly and Phillips 1994) have linked the PMN to phonological mapping during the lexical selection stage of speech perception..

\pause 

Others (e.g. Newman et al.) report that the PMN is a __marker of acoustic and pre-lexical information__. 

## Connolly and Phillips (1994)

Event-Related Potential Components Reflect Phonological and Semantic Processing of the Terminal Word of Spoken Sentences: 

\pause

* The piano is out of \pause tune \pause (no mismatch) \pause
* The piano is out of \pause tuna \pause (N400) \pause
* The piano is out of \pause pizza \pause (N400 and PMN) \pause
* ...

## Newman et al. (2003)

Phoneme deletion task to study the PMN:

\pause

Delete /k/ from the word "clap" \pause

* lap \pause
* aap \pause
* dog 

## Phonological Mapping Negativity

Lewendon et. al (2020) suggest that the possibility exists that the PMN is an extension of either the Mismatch Negativity (MMN) or N400 components

## Phonological Mapping Negativity

Lewendon et. al (2020) also report that the majority of the literature on the PMN is characterized by contradictory findings and methodological limitations, e.g.

\small

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\item Contrasting theories of the PMN
\item Mixed topographical locations: 
  \begin{itemize}[<+->]
  \item \footnotesize Some studies report discovering the PMN in frontal and central sites, others in parietal / mid-line / evenly spread across the scalp.
  \end{itemize}
\item \small Methodological limitations: 
  \begin{itemize}[<+->]
  \item \footnotesize Few participants (usually < 10)
  \item \footnotesize Few trials (usually < 40)
  \item \footnotesize Confounding variables
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\normalsize

## Research questions

\pause \small

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\item \textbf{Is the PMN in response to acoustic, phonetic, phonological, lexical mapping and mismatch, none or a combination of all?}
\item \textbf{Is any other ERP component found in response to acoustic, phonetic and phonological mismatch in place of / together with the PMN?}
\end{itemize}

\normalsize

## Research questions

Why the PMN.. \pause _and why now?_

\small \pause

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\item The PMN (placed in between phonetic and lexical processing) might play a key role in future investigations into architectures of grammar and speech perception 
\item Clinical studies have recently used the PMN as a \emph{marker of phonological processing abilities in patient populations} (Robson et al. 2017). However, it is not clear what processes the PMN really indexes. 
\end{itemize}

\normalsize

# Experiment 1

## Procedure

\small

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\item Participants were trained to learn three pairs of tri-syllabic nonce words, presented auditorily, in a computerized training phase (e.g. \emph{pitabu dipida})
  \begin{itemize}[<+->]
  \item \footnotesize Transitional probabilities within the two items of each nonce-word pair was 1.0 
  \end{itemize}
\item \small Participants were tested on their knowledge of the experimental stimuli in a computerized task
\item During EEG data collection, stimuli were played to participants during a passive listening task, however..
  \begin{itemize}[<+->]
  \item \footnotesize In 33\% of total trials (400 total trials), the first syllable of the second nonce-word of each pair would be manipulated to break expectations
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

## Procedure

\small

\begin{center}

Before training, EEG data was recorded with subjects listening passively to the presentation of matching and mismatching nonce-word pairs. This was done in order to estabilish a baseline. 

\end{center}

\normalsize

## Stimuli 

\begin{center}

pitabu \pause dipida \pause

pitabu \pause \textbf{ba}pida \pause

pitabu \pause \textbf{bu}pida \pause

## Stimuli

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\item Stimuli were synthesized using Mac OS Text-to-Speech
\item Stimuli concept from Astheimer and Sanders (2011), who controlled for transitional probabilities, resemblance to real words, etc.
\item Vowel, syllable and word length were controlled (each syllable was 200 ms long)
\item Speaker and pitch contours were the same for all stimuli.
\end{itemize}

## Participants

22 Participants (F = 13) took part to the experiment. \pause

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\item 22 right-handed adults
\item 22 BrE speakers
\item Age (M = 20, 18-25)

# General Discussion

## PMN?

Contrasting findings in PMN literature cause: 

\small \begin{itemize}[<+->]
\item Difficulty in determining whether an observed response matches the PMN (in function and topographical distribution)
\item Easy to mistake any component in a similar range as the PMN
\item Bulk of the (very limited) literature on the PMN attributed to one research group
\end{itemize}

## PMN?

The PMN appears to be linked to lexical processing more than to the processing of pre-lexical information (including acoustic and phonetic information). \pause

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\item This supports earlier theories of the PMN (e.g. Connolly \& Phillips 1994)
\item Goes against later interpretations (e.g. Newman et al. 2003)
\item How much of the PMN is in response to phonological information specifically? 
  \begin{itemize}[<+->]
  \item Issues with uses of PMN in clinical settings
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

## Other findings

Earlier responses (150-200 ms) and later P600-like effects reinforce: \pause

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\item Mismatch stimuli were recognised as such
\item Early, acoustic / phonetic mismatch
\item P600 as an index of sequence violation
\end{itemize}

Could the PMN be a later instance of the MMN?

## Future directions

\pause

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\item Explore other responses to stimulus presentation in Exp 1 and 2
\item Determine whether they are to acoustic, phonetic, phonological features of stimuli..
  \begin{itemize}[<+->]
  \item \footnotesize Done in Exp 3. Data collection interrupted by COVID-19
  \end{itemize}
\item \small Try different paradigms that isolate phonological and lexical processing
\end{itemize}

## Methodological limitations

If we consider the non-observation of the PMN as a cause of methodological limitations: \pause

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\item PMN most likely not reliable enough as a marker for clinical experiments
\item Not a good candidate for experiments investigating information flow order in speech perception
\end{itemize}
